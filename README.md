# **Hiring Assistant Chatbot**

This is a **Hiring Assistant Chatbot** built using **Streamlit**, **Google Gemini AI**, and **MongoDB**. The chatbot collects user details, asks technical questions based on the user's tech stack, evaluates their responses, and stores the results in a MongoDB database.
